<p class="highlight">Originally from Arizona, I received my bachelor’s in political science from the University of Arizona in 2016 with a focus on international relations and my master's in political science from the University of Mannheim (Germany) in 2019 with a focus on quantitative methods. </p>
<p>Through my academic training and research experiences, I’ve learned a great deal about research methods and quantitative data analysis for the social sciences. I'm eager to use these skills to investigate matters of international security and conflict more rigorously.</p>
<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My research interests are constantly developing as I dive deeper into familiar topics or introduce myself to brand new ones. Generally speaking, though, I am interested in studying conflict, particularly with regard to emerging technologies and the future of warfare. Enormous security challenges lay ahead and sound research will greatly assist in developing sound policy.</p>
<!--<p><em>I am actively seeking research positions in the area of international affairs to begin in 2020. I look forward to the next opportunity to learn and grow!</em></p>-->

<h3>Cyber-Savvy Users: A New Line of Defense</h3>
<h4>Internship Project, Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (Oct-Dec 2019)</h4>
<p>This research project contributes to discussions on cyber deterrence and defense by arguing that the public shares an important role in these efforts. User-centered approaches to cybersecurity offer great opportunities for enhanced deterrence and defense against cyber threats. This analysis will examine published national strategies of over 50 countries to determine which states include such approaches and to what extent.</p>

<h3>Efficacy of Third-Party Airstrikes in Counterinsurgencies: Evidence from Yemen</h3>
<h4>Master's Thesis, University of Mannheim (Sep 2019)</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  A Saudi-led coalition has launched more than 20,000 air raids since 2015 in Yemen’s ongoing civil war against the Houthis. What effect does this counterinsurgency strategy have on subsequent insurgent attacks? While there is a general consensus that indiscriminate violence is often counterproductive in such conflicts, the effects in Yemen have yet to be analyzed empirically. Following similar studies, I first use geospatial matching and difference-in-differences estimation on event-level conflict data in Yemen to test whether insurgent attacks increase within varying spatial and temporal windows after an airstrike. Since I observe that the majority of airstrikes do not experience any insurgent attacks within the geographic and temporal vicinity after a strike, I also conduct a second test to investigate whether the Houthis increase their attacks in Saudi Arabia, particularly in response to fatal airstrikes. I argue that the relationship between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia plays a role in shaping conflict dynamics within the context of this third-party counterinsurgency strategy. Results suggest that insurgent attacks increase both in the geographic vicinity of airstrikes and in Saudi territory. While the effects are small, these findings illuminate the unique impact fatal airstrikes have on rebel activity. Despite a number of limitations in these two analyses, this study adds further support to the general consensus that indiscriminate violence is not an effective strategy towards reducing insurgent attacks. <a href="https://github.com/jessidraper/jessicadraper/raw/master/files/Draper MA Thesis 2019.pdf">DOWNLOAD PDF</a></p>
