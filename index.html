<h2>Aspiring junior researcher</h2>
<p>I am currently a second-year master’s student studying political science at the University of Mannheim in Germany. Originally from Arizona, I received my bachelor’s in political science at the University of Arizona with a focus on international relations. </p>
<p>In my master's, I’ve learned a great deal about research methods and quantitative data analysis for the social sciences. I now feel better prepared to investigate matters of international security and conflict more rigorously.</p>
<p>Despite not having had any coursework on arms control or emerging military technologies, I find these topics fascinating and would like to pursue a research career in this area. I am deeply curious about the increasing use of “remote violence” in conflicts and how automation and the proliferation of unmanned weapon systems will fundamentally change the dynamics of war. Enormous security challenges lay ahead and sound research will greatly assist in developing sound policy.
<p>I am currently seeking research internships in the area of international affairs before applying to junior research positions.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<h3>Effect of Third-Party Airstrikes on Rebel Activity: Evidence from Yemen</h3>
<p>I am currently working on my master's thesis which will examine the effect of the Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen on Houthi activity. While previous studies have sought to test similar effects in other cases using geographic matching methods, I find theoretical issues with this approach and offer a potential alternative. </p>
